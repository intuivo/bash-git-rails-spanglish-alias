Bash git-rails Spanish Aliases and shortcuts
===========================================

Bash aliases for developing under Linux for rails, and git

### Concept:
> Since everything in English is a reserved word. Spanish or any other language happens to be very useful, because it allows me the liberty of adding more commands. There are also many ways of saying something in Spanish.


### Install:
> Just copy paste it in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`
files then `source ~/.bash_profile` to it.


### Code:
Just download `.bash_spanish_dev` file
